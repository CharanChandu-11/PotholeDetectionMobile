***Kavya Sahithi***
*Worked on brainstorming ideas for the smart pothole detection and management system and created the storyboard. This included mapping out user interactions for commuters (uploading images/videos with location and description) and municipal authorities (dashboard view, prioritization, and proof-based updates).
*No pull requests as of now.
*Newly assigned task: Preparing and presenting the problem statement and UX wireframes

**Yoshith**
*He created the mobile test plan for the Pothole Detection (PHD) application with 20 well-defined functional test cases covering core user journeys, including app permissions (camera, location), media capture and upload, AI-based pothole detection, report submission, status tracking, and navigation. All cases have clear expected outcomes, ensuring traceability and repeatability. Test descriptions are concise and action-oriented, enabling efficient execution. In addition to comprehensive positive scenario coverage, He also incorporated negative tests (e.g., permission denial, invalid file formats, no internet connectivity), performance tests (e.g., large file uploads, high report volume), and security validations (e.g., GPS spoofing prevention, data privacy checks) to further strengthen the reliability, resilience, and security of the mobile application.
*No pull requests as of now.
*Newly assigned task: Answer queries on the Wireframe from the Web & Cloud and Mobile teams.

**Ramsai**
*He conducted a comprehensive review of the entire PHD (Desktop) Test Cases file, covering all 20 entries to ensure accuracy, clarity, and consistency. Each test case was checked for a unique ID, a clear and descriptive summary, and a well-defined expected result aligned with system requirements. He verified that there were no missing values, duplicates, or formatting issues, confirming the file’s structural integrity. His analysis also evaluated the quality and readiness of the test cases for real-world execution, ensuring descriptions were unambiguous and expected outcomes measurable. The dataset is clean, well-organized, and ready for immediate use in testing, reporting, and documentation, supporting effective quality assurance processes.
