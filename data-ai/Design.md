YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that uses a single neural network to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images.
Google Cloud Vision API – uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, object detection, and OCR.
Amazon Rekognition – employs deep learning models, mainly region-based CNNs (R-CNN variants), for face detection, object recognition, and video analysis.
Microsoft Azure Computer Vision – combines CNNs and transformer-based vision models for tagging, scene understanding, and OCR.
Clarifai API – utilizes CNNs and custom embedding models for visual search, detection, and classification tasks.

These APIs implement deep learning architectures such as CNNs, R-CNN variants, and transformer-based vision models to analyze images. The process generally involves feature extraction, object localization, and classification to provide insights from visual data. The analysis ensures accurate detection, categorization, and description of visual elements for integration into applications.
