# Design - Data & AI for Crowd Monitor

## Data Collection

TODO(Pranavi1110): Fill this section based on your analysis.

For this project, pothole data will be collected from multiple sources to ensure variety and robustness for AI model training. The primary dataset used is the Pothole Detection Dataset â€“ by Atulyakumar98 from Kaggle, which contains ~300 labeled road images in two categories:
potholes â€“ images with visible potholes
normal â€“ images without potholes

**Primary Data Source**
Dataset Name: Pothole Detection Dataset â€“ by Atulyakumar98
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulyakumar98/pothole-detection-dataset
Type: Binary Image Classification (Computer Vision)
Format: JPEG images in folder-based separation (no nested folders, no train/test split provided)

**Additional Data Collection Strategies**
â€¢Crowdsourcing: Mobile app feature to allow citizens to upload pothole images along with GPS coordinates.
â€¢Government & Municipal Records: Road maintenance archives containing pothole photographs and repair logs.
â€¢On-Vehicle Cameras: Dashcam/IoT-based continuous road scanning for real-time data capture.
â€¢Drone Surveillance: Aerial road scans for large-scale detection.

**Data Collection Challenges**
â€¢Limited size of existing datasets (risk of overfitting).
â€¢Variation in image resolution and quality.
â€¢Different lighting conditions, angles, and road textures.
â€¢Absence of metadata (time, location, severity).
â€¢Potential mislabeling in public datasets.

**Preprocessing Requirements**
â€¢Resize images to a consistent resolution (e.g., 224Ã—224 px).
â€¢Normalize pixel values for uniform input.
â€¢Apply data augmentation (rotation, flips, brightness adjustment) to improve generalization.
â€¢Split dataset into train/validation/test sets while keeping class balance.

## Generic chatbots
Generic chatbots use : CHATGPT,GOOGLE GEMINI
Dataset Name  : Pothole Detection Dataset â€“ by Atulyakumar98
Dataset Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulyakumar98/pothole-detection-dataset
Domain : Computer Vision â€“ Binary Image Classification (Pothole vs. Normal Road)
Data Description : Contains 300+ JPEG images grouped into two main categories: 
â€¢ potholes  â€“ road images with visible potholes
â€¢ normal â€“ road images without potholes
File Structure : Simple folder-based class separation with no nested folders. No separate train/test folders provided.
Image Resolution : Mixed resolutions â€” varies from low-quality compressed images to high-resolution road captures. Requires resizing before training.
Image Variety :
 Images vary in: 
â€¢ Lighting (daylight, cloudy, shaded)
â€¢ Camera angles (top-down, side view) 
â€¢ Road types (asphalt, concrete, rural paths)
Data Quality :
Moderate â€” Some images have low sharpness or contain background distractions (cars, pedestrians, road markings). No major noise or irrelevant content.
Potential Issues : 
Small dataset size â†’ high risk of overfitting; 
No metadata;
No location/time diversity info; 
Folder labeling assumes perfect accuracy.

Dataset is suitable for beginners to practice binary classification.Mixed image qualities might help generalization but require normalization.Absence of bounding boxes limits use for object detection tasks.

## Pre-built APIs

## ðŸš§ Recommended APIs for Pothole Detection Prototype

### **High Priority**
1. **Roboflow YOLOv8 API** â€“ Fastest option for building a working pothole detection model.  
   *Add-on:* Can also use **Google Gemini API** or **OpenAI Vision API** for detection and classification as a secondary or hybrid approach.  
2. **Expo Location API** â€“ Tags pothole coordinates in the mobile app.  
3. **Google Maps SDK** â€“ Displays detected potholes in both the app and dashboard.  

### **Medium Priority**
4. **Firebase Firestore + Storage** â€“ Simple backend to store pothole data and images/videos.  
5. **Firebase Auth** â€“ Enables commuter/engineer login with role-based UI.  
6. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** â€“ Sends updates on pothole resolution to users.  


## Vision Algorithms
TODO(Raavi-Havish): Fill this section based on your analysis.

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that uses a single neural network to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images.
Google Cloud Vision API â€“ uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, object detection, and OCR.
Amazon Rekognition â€“ employs deep learning models, mainly region-based CNNs (R-CNN variants), for face detection, object recognition, and video analysis.
Microsoft Azure Computer Vision â€“ combines CNNs and transformer-based vision models for tagging, scene understanding, and OCR.
Clarifai API â€“ utilizes CNNs and custom embedding models for visual search, detection, and classification tasks. Expo location api uses Uses mobile deviceâ€™s native GPS + accelerometer sensors, wrapped via React Nativeâ€™s expo-location module.Google maps sdk,firebase firestore+storage uses no specific algorithm.FCM uses no ai,uses pub or sub notification mechanism.Firebase Auth uses Uses OAuth2.0, Secure Token Authentication (JWT) internally.

These APIs implement deep learning architectures such as CNNs, R-CNN variants, and transformer-based vision models to analyze images. The process generally involves feature extraction, object localization, and classification to provide insights from visual data. The analysis ensures accurate detection, categorization, and description of visual elements for integration into applications.
