# Product Group 2 - Pothole Mapper for Safer Roads 

**Problem** - Municipal organizations often struggle to maintain up-to-date records of road damage, especially potholes, which can significantly affect daily commutes and road safety. Traditional methods of road inspections are resource-intensive and infrequent, resulting in delayed repairs and citizen dissatisfaction.


**Solution** - PotHoleMapper is a community-driven solution that leverages mobile devices and AI to detect and report potholes in real-time. By empowering citizens to participate in the data collection process, the application improves infrastructure visibility, reduces response times, and supports proactive maintenance efforts.
